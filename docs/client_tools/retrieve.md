# Retrieve your files

## Introduction

As tasks are completed, rendered files are made available to download. You may use the Conductor Downloader tool to fetch files to your local disk. Files are downloaded to the output path that was specified when the job was submitted.

The Downloader can operate in one of two modes:

* Manual (Explicit mode)  
* Automatic (Daemon mode)

For more details, [see the Conductor CLI](./cli.md)
